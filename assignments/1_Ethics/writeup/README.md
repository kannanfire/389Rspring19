### Part 2 (75 pts)

If you, as a security auditor of the ECUâ€™s firmware, conclude that there are numerous complex and exploitable security issues within the system, you must do everything in your power to prevent the danger presented to the occupants in addition to the car. You should start by telling your boss, including anyone higher up than your boss if possible. If they follow their moral obligations, they would cancel the release of the product until the firmware has all its security issues resolved. If they do not follow those obligations, then you should be trying to get the information out to the public as quickly as possible. You could then approach consumer watchdogs or even the public directly, starting with the consumer watchdogs. If you choose to do nothing, then you are entirely responsible for the harm that results. If you never report it to any of your bosses or anyone else, then you have no way of knowing whether changes would have been made or not. Another resulting ethical dilemma is what you should do when you have done everything you possibly could. The only option you would have to distance yourself from the company and keep reaching out to news outlets and the public in the hopes that they react to your security discoveries.
