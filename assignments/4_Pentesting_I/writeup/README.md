## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

The flag found in flag.txt within the home directly is CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_th0ough_1njec7ion}. 
	The inputs used to access Moffet’s bank server were "1337bank.money; ls" in order to find the directory list, "1337bank.money; cd home" to enter and view the home directory, and "1337bank.money; ls" a second time to view all the files in the home directory, and "1337bank.money; cat flag.txt" to view the file once we return to the home directory. Each of these commands can be simplified and reduced into one command, "1337bank.money; cd home; cat flag.txt". The common factor within each of these commands is the semicolon, because it allows the adversary to perform command injection by starting up another process in the server terminal.  
Trying to find the flag was testing each directory until a clue was shown as to where the flag might be. I started in order by going through the directories starting at bin directory, proceeding to boot directory, and so on until I reached the home directory. Once in the home directory, I ran the ls command to see where I could move forward to, within which I found the flag.txt file. In order to see the file, I reran the previous command used to see all files within the home directory except I replaced the ls command with the “cat flag.txt” command, which made the command “1337bank.money; cd home; cat flag.txt”, which gave me access to the flag we were assigned to search for. 
	Elizabeth Moffet can prevent a command injection into her bank server by simply altering the strings that are passed into the server. In this example, any data that is passed in by an adversary can have a semicolon removed, or any other operator for unix terminals. Through the removal of any semicolon, the adversary cannot attack the server directly and view the contents of all the data. If they have no access, they have no information to view and steal. In other cases, characters can be escaped in order to prevent a command injection in the same manner.
