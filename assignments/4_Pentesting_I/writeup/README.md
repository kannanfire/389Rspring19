## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

The flag found in flag.txt within the home directly is CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_th0ough_1njec7ion}. 
	The inputs used to access Moffet’s bank server were "1337bank.money; ls" in order to find the directory list, "1337bank.money; cd home" to enter and view the home directory, and "1337bank.money; ls" a second time to view all the files in the home directory, and "1337bank.money; cat flag.txt" to view the file once we return to the home directory. Each of these commands can be simplified and reduced into one command, "1337bank.money; cd home; cat flag.txt". The common factor within each of these commands is the semicolon, because it allows the adversary to perform command injection by starting up another process in the server terminal.  
Trying to find the flag was testing each directory until a clue was shown as to where the flag might be. I started in order by going through the directories starting at bin directory, proceeding to boot directory, and so on until I reached the home directory. Once in the home directory, I ran the ls command to see where I could move forward to, within which I found the flag.txt file. In order to see the file, I reran the previous command used to see all files within the home directory except I replaced the ls command with the “cat flag.txt” command, which made the command “1337bank.money; cd home; cat flag.txt”, which gave me access to the flag we were assigned to search for. 
	Elizabeth Moffet can prevent a command injection into her bank server by simply altering the strings that are passed into the server. In this example, any data that is passed in by an adversary can have a semicolon removed, or any other operator for unix terminals. Through the removal of any semicolon, the adversary cannot attack the server directly and view the contents of all the data. If they have no access, they have no information to view and steal. In other cases, characters can be escaped in order to prevent a command injection in the same manner.

There are four initial commands that can be applied to this are quit, help, pull, and shell. Help is a very simple command that provides a simple description of each command. Quit just exits the program. Pull is slightly more complicated than the last two commands as it requires specific file paths. Pull downloads the file from within the remote server and places it in a user specified location. The command follows as <pull> <argument1> <argument2> with each <> being replaced by a file location from the server and the local file location, respectively. The shell command is the most complicated where it requires knowledge of basic unix commands. Once shell is entered, you are placed into the root of the remote server. You can then access files using cat or other unix commands, or view the files and directories using ls. Another feature to access directories is <cd> <argument1> where the user can access a specific directory. One feature that is not implemented is <cd ..> which does not put the user in the previous directory, the only way to go backwards in this shell implementation is using cd, returning to the root directory and going back into the file directory.
